# Floyd v6

**A private Legacy AI rebrand of [Charm Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush) v0.92.0 (FSL-1.1-MIT). Not affiliated with Charm. Internal use only — never redistributed.**

Floyd is the Legacy AI coding harness: your tools, your code, and your workflows, wired into your LLM of choice, wearing Floyd's name, persona system, hooks, and identity layer.

## Build (local only — this fork is not published)

```bash
go build -o floyd .
```

Upstream documentation for engine features lives at https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush — subsystem behavior is unchanged unless documented in this repo.

## Features

- **Multi-Model:** choose from a wide range of LLMs or add your own via OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible APIs
- **Flexible:** switch LLMs mid-session while preserving context
- **Session-Based:** maintain multiple work sessions and contexts per project
- **LSP-Enhanced:** Floyd uses LSPs for additional context, just like you do
- **Extensible:** add capabilities via MCPs (`http`, `stdio`, and `sse`)
- **Works Everywhere:** first-class support in every terminal on macOS, Linux, Windows (PowerShell and WSL), Android, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD
- **Industrial Grade:** built on the Charm ecosystem, powering 25k+ applications, from leading open source projects to business-critical infrastructure

## Installation

This is a private fork. Install locally from this repository and use the fleet wrappers:

```bash
go build -o floyd .
# fleet wrappers (superfloyd, floyd-10x, floyd-agents) exec this binary
# with per-identity data dirs under ~/.floyd-*
```

There is no Homebrew/NPM/winget package for Floyd. Those routes belong to upstream Crush.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to choose a [Hyper][hyper] model from model
picker. Follow the steps to authenticate and you'll be good to go.

[Hyper], from Charm, is the official Floyd provider. It’s subscription-based,
with a free tier, and optimized for Floyd. It’s privacy focused, with zero data
retention (ZDR) is and designed to comply with GDPR. [More on Hyper][hyper].

## API Keys

You can also use Floyd with many other providers such as Anthopic, OpenAI,
Gemini, OpenRouter and so on. Press <kbd>ctrl+l</kbd> to open the model picker,
choose the provider of your choice, and paste your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers:

Also note that Floyd can support nearly any provider, including
[Local Models](#local-models). For more info see
[Custom Providers](#custom-providers) below.

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Floyd? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Floyd’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Floyd-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk"><img width="174" height="174" alt="Catwalk Badge" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d" /></a>

## Configuration

> [!TIP]
> Floyd ships with a builtin skill for configuring itself. Most of the time
> you can just tell what you want it to configure and it will get the job done.

Floyd runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Floyd, you can, with a `floydrc`.

A `floydrc` is just Bash with some Floyd-specific builtins. It’s a lot like
a `.bashrc`, just for your Floyd. Because Floyd has a native, built-in Bash
interpreter, Bash-based config works identically across all platforms, including
Windows.

For example:

```bash
# Add Ollama.
provider add ollama --type ollama --base-url "http://localhost:11434/v1"

# Register a model on Ollama.
model add ollama/llama3.3 --name "Llama 3.3" --context-window 128000

# Auto-approve some tools.
permissions allow view edit

# Include some other file on a specific machine.
if [[ $HOSTNAME == "babysquid" ]]; then
    source ~/my-stuff/babysquid.sh
fi

# Add an MCP server, with a GitHub API token stored in 1Password.
mcp add github \
  --type http \
  --url "https://api.github.com/mcp/" \
  --header Authorization "Bearer $(op read 'op://my-secret-key')"
```

Configuration can be added either local to the project itself, or globally,
with the following priority:

| Priority | Unix-like                 | Windows                               |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `./.floydrc`              | `.\.floydrc`                          |
| 2        | `./floydrc`               | `.\floydrc`                           |
| 3        | `~/.config/floyd/floydrc` | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\floyd\floydrc` |

(Floyd respects the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg], so your paths
may differ depending on your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` value. Data directories such as
`~/.local/share/floyd` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\floyd` contain JSON state only; Floyd
does not execute a `floydrc` from them.)

[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

What about the old JSON format? It’s still supported, but it should be
considered deprecated. See: [the config docs](./docs/config/) for details.

> [!TIP]
> You can override the user and data config locations by setting:
>
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_CONFIG`
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_DATA`

As an additional note, Floyd also stores ephemeral data, such as application
state, in one additional location. This is state and should not be edited by
hand, nor should it be considered configuration.

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/floyd/floyd.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\floyd\floyd.json
```

#### A note on security

Both `floydrc` and `floyd.json` are trusted code; `floydrc` runs in a full
shell, and any `$(...)` in `floyd.json` runs at load time. Don't launch Floyd
in a directory whose config you haven't reviewed, and don't randomly `source`
files from the internet into your config.

### Environment Variables

The top-level `env` field sets environment variables at startup, before
providers are configured. This is useful for variables that affect provider
authentication (e.g. the AWS SDK credential chain) without wrapping the
`floyd` command in a shell script or exporting them in your shell profile:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/floyd.json",
  "env": {
    "AWS_PROFILE": "my-sso-profile"
  }
}
```

Values support the same `$VAR` and `$(command)` expansion as other config
fields, so you can reference existing environment variables or shell out for
a value.

### LSPs

Floyd can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```bash
# floydrc

lsp add go --command "gopls" --env "GOTOOLCHAIN go1.24.5"
lsp add typescript --command "typescript-language-server" --args --stdio
lsp add nix --command "nil"
```

### MCPs

Floyd also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three transport
types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints, and `sse`
for Server-Sent Events.

```bash
# floydrc

# Add a local MCP server that runs a Node.js script.
mcp add filesystem --command node --args /path/to/mcp-server.js \
  --timeout 10 --disabled-tools some-tool-name --env NODE_ENV production

# Add a GitHub MCP server that uses an API token.
mcp add github --type http --url https://api.github.com/mcp/ \
  --timeout 10 --header Authorization "Bearer $GH_PAT" \
  --disabled-tools create_issue --disabled-tools create_pull_request

# Add a streaming MCP server that uses SSE.
mcp add streaming-service --type sse --url "https://example.com/mcp/sse" \
  --timeout 10 --header API-Key "$API_KEY"
```

#### MCP OAuth

HTTP and SSE MCP servers that require OAuth can use Floyd's built-in
authorization-code flow instead of a static `Authorization` header. Set
`"oauth": true` to enable it:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "linear": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
      "oauth": true
    }
  }
}
```

##### Pre-registered clients

Some servers (GitHub, Slack) don't support dynamic client registration.
For those, register an OAuth app with the provider and supply the
credentials directly. All values support shell expansion:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/mcp/",
      "oauth": true,
      "oauth_client_id": "Iv1.abc123def456",
      "oauth_client_secret": "$GITHUB_MCP_SECRET",
      "oauth_callback_port": 40704
    }
  }
}
```

When `oauth_client_id` is set, Floyd skips dynamic client registration
and authenticates as the specified client. When omitted, Floyd attempts
dynamic registration automatically (works with Linear, Notion, and other
servers that support RFC 7591).

#### Sessionless servers

Some HTTP MCP servers are sessionless — they never issue a
`Mcp-Session-Id` and reject the `subscriptions/listen` stream Floyd opens
for list-changed notifications, which would otherwise break the
connection. Floyd auto-detects known sessionless servers (GitHub MCP,
`api.githubcopilot.com/mcp`), so those need no extra configuration.

For other sessionless servers, mark them explicitly with
`"sessionless": true` (or `--sessionless true` in `floydrc`); set it to
`false` to force the default behavior for an auto-detected URL. The
tradeoff is that a sessionless server won't push live
tool/prompt/resource list-changed notifications.

### Hooks

Floyd has preliminary support for hooks. For details, see
[the hook guide](./docs/hooks/).

### Sharing a workspace across clients

When Floyd is run against a shared backend (for example two TUIs talking to
the same `floyd serve`), clients are grouped into **workspaces** keyed by
their resolved `--cwd`. Two clients with the same `--cwd` join the same
underlying workspace, so they share the session list, message history,
permission queue, LSP, and MCP state.

Joining is implicit: pointing a second client at the same working directory
attaches it to the existing workspace. Each new invocation, however, starts
in its own fresh session by default. To pick up the conversation another
client already has open, use the session manager (the session picker) and
select it. Sessions surface two signals there:

- `IsBusy` is set while an agent turn is in flight for that session.
- `AttachedClients` reports how many clients are currently viewing it.

A non-zero `AttachedClients` (often combined with `IsBusy`) is the cue that a
session is "in progress" on another client and joining it will mirror that
view live.

The first client to create a workspace fixes its process-wide flags. In
particular, `--yolo` and `--debug` follow a **first-wins** rule: later
clients that arrive at the same `--cwd` with different values for those
flags do not change the running workspace. A debug log line is emitted
recording the mismatch, and the workspace keeps the flags it was created
with.

A workspace lives as long as at least one client has an SSE event stream
open against it. When the last stream disconnects, the workspace is torn
down. There is a short grace window right after `POST /v1/workspaces` so a
client that has created the workspace but not yet opened its event stream
does not get reaped before it can attach.

### Global context files

Floyd automatically includes two files for cross-project instructions. Think of
these are personal additions to the system prompt.

- `~/.config/floyd/CRUSH.md`: Floyd-specific rules that would confuse other
  agentic coding tools. If you only use Floyd, this is the only one you need to
  edit.
- `~/.config/AGENTS.md`: generic instructions that other coding tools might
  read. Avoid referring to Floyd-specific features or workflows here. You
  probably only care about this if you use multiple agentic coding tools and
  want to share instructions between them.

You can customize these paths with `option global-context-path`. Repeat the
command to add multiple paths:

```bash
# Load a single markdown file.
option global-context-path "~/path/to/custom/context/file.md"

# Recursively load all Markdown files in the folder.
option global-context-path "/full/path/to/folder/of/files/"
```

### Ignoring Files

Floyd respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.floydignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Floyd
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don't want Floyd to consider when providing context.

The `.floydignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Floyd will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you'd like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```bash
permissions allow view ls grep edit mcp_context7_get-library-doc
```

### Disabling Built-In Tools

You can also deny tools, hiding then from the agent entirely:

```bash
permissions deny bash sourcegraph
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### You only live once

You can also skip all permission prompts completely by running Floyd with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Disabling Skills

You can prevent Floyd from using certain skills entirely. Disabled skills are
hidden from the agent, including builtin skills and skills discovered from
disk.

```bash
option disable-skill floyd-config
```

### Agent Skills

Floyd supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard for
extending agent capabilities with reusable skill packages. Skills are folders
containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Floyd can discover and
activate on demand.

The global paths we looks for skills are:

- `$CRUSH_SKILLS_DIR`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents/skills` or `~/.config/agents/skills/`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/floyd/skills` or `~/.config/floyd/skills/`
- `~/.agents/skills/`
- `~/.claude/skills/`
- On Windows, we _also_ look at
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agents\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\agents\skills\`
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\floyd\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\floyd\skills\`
- Additional paths configured via `options.skills_paths`

On top of that, we _also_ load skills in your project from the following
relative paths:

- `.agents/skills`
- `.floyd/skills`
- `.claude/skills`
- `.cursor/skills`

Or load directories of skills specifically in your config:

```bash
option skill-path "$HOME/squid-skills" "./other-skills"
```

You can get started with example skills from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

```bash
# Unix
mkdir -p ~/.config/floyd/skills
cd ~/.config/floyd/skills
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . && rm -rf _temp
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
mkdir -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\floyd\skills"
cd "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\floyd\skills"
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . ; rm -r -force _temp
```

#### User-Invocable Skills

Skills can be made invocable as commands from the commands palette
(<kbd>ctrl+p</kbd>). Add `user-invocable: true` to the skill's YAML
frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-hot-skill
description: A skill that can be invoked as a command.
user-invocable: true
---
```

User-invocable skills appear in the commands palette with a `user:` or `project:` prefix:

- Skills from global directories show as `user:skill-name`
- Skills from project directories show as `project:skill-name`

When invoked, the skill's instructions are loaded into the conversation context.

To prevent the model from auto-triggering a skill (while still allowing user invocation), add `disable-model-invocation: true`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Only invocable by users, not the model.
user-invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

Skills with `disable-model-invocation` won't appear in the model's available skills list but can still be invoked manually by users.

### Desktop notifications

Floyd sends desktop notifications when a tool call requires permission and when
the agent finishes its turn. They're only sent when the terminal window isn't
focused _and_ your terminal supports reporting the focus state.

```bash
# Choose auto, native, osc, bell, or disabled.
option notifications disabled
```

`auto` uses native notifications locally and OSC notifications over SSH when
supported.

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Floyd analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions. By
default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the name and
location with the `initialize-as` option:

```bash
# floydrc
option initialize-as AGENTS.md
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to place the
file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or `docs/LLMs.md`). Floyd will
fill the file with project-specific context like build commands, code patterns,
and conventions it discovered during initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Floyd adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with `option` commands:

```bash
option attribution-trailer-style co-authored-by
option attribution-generated-with true
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
  - `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: Floyd:[ModelID]` as specified in [the convention](https://docs.kernel.org/process/coding-assistants.html#attribution)
  - `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Floyd <floyd@charm.land>`
  - `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Floyd` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Floyd supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that we support two "types" for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
> to ensure the best experience!
>
> - `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
> - `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don't forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```bash
provider add deepseek --type openai-compat \
  --base-url "https://api.deepseek.com/v1" \
  --api-key "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"

model add deepseek/deepseek-chat \
  --name "Deepseek V3" \
  --context-window 64000 \
  --default-max-tokens 5000 \
  --price-input 0.27 \
  --price-output 1.1 \
  --price-cache-create 1.1 \
  --price-cache-hit 0.07
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```bash
provider add custom-anthropic \
  --type anthropic \
  --base-url "https://api.anthropic.com/v1" \
  --api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  --extra-header anthropic-version 2023-06-01

model add custom-anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
  --name "Claude Sonnet 4" \
  --context-window 200000 \
  --default-max-tokens 50000 \
  --can-reason true \
  --supports-images true \
  --price-input 3 \
  --price-output 15 \
  --price-cache-create 3.75 \
  --price-cache-hit 0.3
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Floyd currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

A Bedrock provider appears once Floyd can find AWS credentials. You can
authenticate in one of two ways:

**API key.** Set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` to a Bedrock API key. This is the
simplest option and never expires mid-session.

**AWS credential chain (SSO, profiles, access keys).** Configure AWS the usual
way with `aws configure` or `aws configure sso`. Floyd picks up whatever the
AWS SDK credential chain resolves, including `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
/ `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or an SSO session. To select a specific profile,
set `AWS_PROFILE` in your shell (`AWS_PROFILE=myprofile floyd`) or in the
top-level [`env`](#environment-variables) config.

If you authenticate via AWS SSO, your session expires periodically. Set
`aws_auth_refresh` to a command that refreshes it. When Bedrock returns a
credential error, Floyd runs the command, then retries the request in place
(no duplicate messages, no manual restart):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/floyd.json",
  "env": {
    "AWS_PROFILE": "my-sso-profile"
  },
  "providers": {
    "bedrock": {
      "aws_auth_refresh": "aws sso login --profile my-sso-profile"
    },
    "bedrock-europe": {
      "aws_auth_refresh": "aws sso login --profile my-eu-sso-profile"
    }
  }
}
```

- `aws_auth_refresh` — shell command run when AWS credentials expire (e.g. `aws sso login`)

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```bash
# floydrc — authentication still comes from gcloud and the VERTEXAI_* env vars.
provider add vertexai --type google-vertex

model add vertexai/claude-sonnet-4@20250514 \
  --name "VertexAI Sonnet 4" \
  --context-window 200000 \
  --default-max-tokens 50000 \
  --can-reason true \
  --supports-images true \
  --price-input 3 \
  --price-output 15 \
  --price-cache-create 3.75 \
  --price-cache-hit 0.3
```

### Local Models

Floyd can auto-discovers models from local providers. Add a custom provider
with `type` set to `llamacpp`, `omlx`, `lmstudio`, `litellm`, or `ollama`
and leave out the models list. Floyd will populate the model list
automatically.

```bash
# Piece of cake.
provider add ollama \
  --name Ollama \
  --type ollama \
  --base-url "http://localhost:11434/v1/"
```

For llama.cpp (`llama-server`), point at the server's base URL:

```bash
provider add llamacpp \
  --name "llama.cpp" \
  --type llamacpp \
  --base-url "http://localhost:2222"
```

#### Manual Model Configuration

You can still list models explicitly. User-defined models always take
precedence over discovered ones, and any fields you set won't be overwritten
by auto-discovery. Auto discovery will run if the model list is empty for any
`openai-compat` provider or if you pass `"discover_models": true` it will merge
the found models with your hand configured ones.

```bash
# floydrc
provider add ollama \
  --name Ollama \
  --type ollama \
  --base-url "http://localhost:11434/v1/" \
  --discover-models true

model add ollama/qwen3:30b \
  --name "Qwen 3 30B" \
  --context-window 256000 \
  --default-max-tokens 20000
```

The `--discover-models true` flag merges discovered models with the one above;
your explicit model fields win on conflicts.

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Floyd logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.floyd/logs/floyd.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
floyd logs

# Print the last 500 lines
floyd logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
floyd logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `floyd` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in your
`floydrc`:

```bash
# floydrc
option debug true
option debug-lsp true
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Floyd automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Floyd provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Floyd automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Custom provider catalog

You can also override [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk) default URL (for testing, using a fork).

You can do so by setting `CATWALK_URL` enviromental variable. (e.g. `export CATWALK_URL=http://localhost:8000`)

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates in your `floydrc`:

```bash
option provider-auto-update false
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `floyd update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
floyd update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
floyd update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
floyd update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at floyd at build time.
floyd update-providers embedded

# For more info:
floyd update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Floyd records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Floyd also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://donottrack.sh/) convention
which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## Q&A

### Why is clipboard copy and paste not working?

Installing an extra tool might be needed on Unix-like environments.

| Environment         | Tool                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows             | Native support           |
| macOS               | Native support           |
| Linux/BSD + Wayland | `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` |
| Linux/BSD + X11     | `xclip` or `xsel`        |
