# 16 — 10X Execution Proof Enforcer

**Value Class:** 10X Multiplier (eliminates plan/execute drift)

```md
Use this when the model plans well but skips execution details.

## Objective
<task>

## Mandatory execution contract
For EACH requested item:
1) Show exact action taken
2) Show direct evidence (file/line/command/output)
3) Show verification result
4) Mark status only after proof

## Forbidden behaviors
- Declaring "done" without evidence
- Collapsing multiple requested items into one vague summary
- Skipping failed steps without explicit blocker report

## Required output structure
A) Requested items checklist
B) Per-item evidence ledger
C) Verification receipts
D) Completeness matrix (item -> done/blocked -> evidence)

## Hard gate
If any requested item has no evidence row, final status MUST be INCOMPLETE.
